# JourneyWise

## Inspiration
We love making websites and traveling, but we found that it was a hassle for us to determine which country to travel to, since some countries may be dangerous, and it takes time to research places for the most optimum traveling experience. Therefore, we decided to create our own website that has all of the information we need to prepare ourselves for new adventures that are to come in the future. 
## What it does
It allows the user to look at all possible cities they can travel to and what places they can go to eat, to watch the beautiful sceneries, and to enjoy and have fun. It also provides information about how safe the country is.
## How we built it
We used Django for authentication and routes. Each one of us tried to do the front end and the back end on our own, then we'd combine our parts together. We get data about the places to visit from apis such Google Maps and Amadeus. We also used JavaScript to add animations and make the website interactive.
## Challenges we ran into
We also had to deal with working together remotely, which we were not used to at first. We also had time zone differences, so someone can be asleep while the other wakes up. Each one of us had different background in web development, so we had to somehow figure out which task suits each team member best.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to work a lot more productively than before since we got used to each other. We were able to accomplish a lot of work despite us only knowing each other for the hackathon period.
## What we learned
We learned that planning and preparing more before the hackathon is really the key to a smooth development experience. We also developed our teamwork skills to a point where we can always rely on each other and know what to expect from one another.
## What's next for JourneyWise
If we had more time, we would have definitely added features like including more countries to our database, added time zones, or special occasions that occur in each country.
